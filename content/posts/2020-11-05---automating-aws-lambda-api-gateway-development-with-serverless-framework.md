This talk gives a slight introduction to AWS Lambda, then moves into how to use the [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) to automate the creation of those Lambda functions and API Gateways.

This was a talk I gave at SyntaxCon 2017 in Charleston, South Carolina. Given how long ago that was, expect the Serverless Framework API to have shifted a little, I urge you to take a look at their documentation to get a more up-to-date version.
