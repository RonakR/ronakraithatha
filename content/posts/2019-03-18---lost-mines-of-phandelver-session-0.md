Recently I've been getting into Dungeons and Dragons a lot more. I have been playing Tabletop RPGs for a couple years now and my urge to play grew larger the more I played. My wife and a couple close friends of mine are all on the nerdy side, enjoy fantasy themes and we all play video games together almost every night. A little before Christmas I decided to become a Dungeon Master and run the Lost Mines of Phandelver for a small group of friends including my wife. 

I was nearing the end of the LMoP campaign I was a part of and figured it would be a good introduction for most of the people I had in mind for my first campaign. Although since 3 of them had never played D&D I figured I would start with a tutorial "one-shot". The characters they played are the ones that came with LMoP so they can get accustomed to what their character is capable of. 

At the moment of orchestrating this tutorial, I had not indented for it be canon. I was going to scrap all the items they acquired and not take into account the experience gain. Even the town mentioned is not part of the Sword Coast.

The campaign below will be told in narrative speech, any sections where I break narrative will be encapsulated as such.

## Setting
Our story pans to the Sword Coast region of the Faer√ªn to a town south of Neverwinter called Ayurn. Ayurn is a small coastal town, sitting a couple miles off The High Road, the road from Neverwinter to Waterdeep. The population of this town is approximately 300-400 denizens, most of whom have been here for all their life. As expected from coastal regions, their main exports are fish and fruits. Both of which are used to trade with towns nearby for other goods. 

Some of the more recent trading expeditions have mentioned a sudden appearance of Goblins along the once empty roads. Not too long after trade expeditions started disappearing, or some traders would make it back to town and yell of a goblin attack on the carts. 

After weeks of facing such attacks, the town's supplies were slowly starting to dwindle. Soon enough there was a shortage of fresh vegetables, poultry and cattle were going unfed and restless, the townsfolk were quickly running out of their basic necessities. 

Ayurn, the townmaster, has sent several swift couriers far and wide asking for any help the other towns could muster. Unfortunately, the other smaller towns didn't have enough fighters ready to help and the massive town of Neverwinter was too busy with their own affairs. During on town meeting, Ayurn sent out a public plea asking for any of the inhabitants that were able to raise a weapon to come to the townmaster's hall tomorrow. 

Next morning seven townsfolk gathered at the townmaster's hall, much to Ayurn's surprise. Ayurn addressed the seven, "We're at a dire point right now, our town is mostly out of supplies and very shortly we will start to weaken a community. If the goblins' plan was to weaken us before attacking then they will be poised to do it in a couple weeks".

She asked the folks there to provide their names, in case the mission was not a successful one and they needed to pay their respects. The first was a human, Jess, she had a nobler air around herself as suggested by how she carried herself.  Another human went after her, Straff, well known around town as a folk hero who helped often when there was trouble with predators coming from woods. A halfing going by Cade sat next to Straff, as the halfling stood, only about as tall as a sitting Straff, he said, " I was part of one of the trade groups, I can lend a hand and offer aid as I have dealt with these goblins before". The dwarf Ruric stood up next, mentioning that he can help tend to anyone that gets wounded. Kira, an elf who has been stranded here due to the lack of safe passage out of this town is desperately longing to get back to her tomes in Neverwinter and wishes to end this goblin distraction. An elderly dwarf goes after her, Alfred. Alfred does not stand up, he's been sitting for a little while now and is having a harder time getting to his feet. He remarks that his age may be getting the better of him lately. After the 6 of them got done, attention turned the last one. In that instant, the lady stood and walked out without emotion or hesitation.
